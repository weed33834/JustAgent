## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial public release.

### Changed

- **LLM gateway: LiteLLM → official OpenAI SDK.** All supported providers
  (OpenAI, Azure, OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, llama.cpp) expose
  OpenAI-compatible endpoints, so the heavy `litellm` dependency is replaced
  by the lighter official `openai` client with a per-provider `base_url`.
  Affects `unified_gateway.py`, `agent/runtime.py`, `knowledge/vector.py`;
  drops `litellm` from `pyproject.toml`, adds `openai`.
- **Fast-fail for key-required backends.** Remote providers (OpenAI,
  OpenRouter, Azure) without a configured API key now fail immediately instead
  of hanging on a doomed network call — e.g. `justagent fix` with no key exits
  cleanly instead of timing out.
- **Skip PyPI/wheel integration tests.** Distribution to PyPI is out of scope,
  so the sdist/wheel install tests are skipped (they required network installs).

### Added

- **`justagent models` command.** Lists every configured model backend
  (provider, model, tier, endpoint, key status) and, with `--check`, runs a
  live connectivity health check. Complements `justagent doctor`.
